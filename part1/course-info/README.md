# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# How to name branches and commits

- git checkout -b "FSB/PartN"
- git checkout -b "FSB/PartN-FeatureX" 

- git commit -m "GastonGarcia/PartN-ExerciseX"
- git commit -m "GastonGarcia/PartN-FeatureX-ExcerciseY"

# Checks for merging to Master branch

- All exercises of the related part (or feature) should be completed.
- Previous exercises should remain up to date and with no changes.
- Clear and concise naming on branches and commits. 
    - If necessary, move the changes to a new branch and delete the older one. 
    - In case of commits, revert commit and create a new commit.
